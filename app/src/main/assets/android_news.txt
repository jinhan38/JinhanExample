Samsung's march to get Android 11 to as many of its devices as possible is showing no signs of slowing down, and today's lucky winner is the Galaxy A70 from 2019. 
This phone received Android 10 in February of last year, and now it's getting One UI 3.1 based on Android 11, way ahead of schedule - it was slotted for May.
The update is currently rolling out in Ukraine, with more countries to follow soon, undoubtedly. 
The over-the-air rollout will ship build A705FNXXU5DUC6 to your Galaxy A70 if you are in Ukraine, and this includes the March 2021 security patch level. 
It's a 1.9GB download, so make sure your connection isn't too slow when you grab it.
